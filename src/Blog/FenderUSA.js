            Fender USA '52 Telecaster Reissue (1992)

            Whilst the subject of this retrospective was made twenty years ago,
            it replicates an instrument built in the dim and distant post-war
            decade, a full sixty years ago. The 1952 Fender Telecaster,
            inseparable from its one and only butterscotch blonde finish, is
            undeniably one of the most iconic visions of the electric guitar
            world. Widely regarded as the design that started the age of the
            solid guitar, and the instrument without which other classics like
            the Gibson Les Paul would simply not have been produced, this early
            incarnation of the Telecaster has a historical importance of even
            greater magnitude than its stunning, simplistic beauty.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            But what really established the Telecaster as a dream guitar in the
            early 1950s, was what it offered to the player. Even now, in
            completely unchanged format, that precise specification of electric
            guitar more than satisfies the demanding needs of many of today’s
            players. After sixty years of technological advancement, the 1952
            Telecaster is STILL considered a highly desirable tool for demanding
            guitarists across a wide range of modern genres and styles. Just
            imagine what a marvel it must have been deep in the steam-powered
            age of the early 1950s.

            Fender USA Vintage Reissue '52 Telecaster (early 1990s) After a 1949
            solid-bodied prototype, and some early experimentation with the
            single pickup Fender Esquire in 1950, Fender introduced the twin
            pickup Broadcaster. The Broadcaster’s model name was changed to
            Telecaster in 1951 after an alleged trademark infringement, but it
            was the same model, and aside from the pickup spec, it was also the
            same model as the Esquire. If you ignore a couple of small tweaks
            and changes to the model name, the Telecaster encapsulated in this
            Fender USA ‘52 Reissue, was the company’s first production guitar.

            In broad terms there’s not much difference between this, the
            original Telecaster design, and the American Fender Standard
            Telecaster of 2012. But for the connoisseur, a wealth of detail and
            spec idiosyncrasies make the ’52 Tele a more enticing proposition.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>This USA‘52 Tele Reissue (circa 1992) is characterised by…</p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li className="blog-li">
              -- A translucent blonde finish on an ash body, with a fully
              accurate rendition of the highly-prized butterscotch colouring,
              achieved the expensive way, with nitro-cellulose lacquer.
            </li>
            <li className="blog-li">
              -- A honey-coloured ‘one-piece’ maple neck, also finished in
              nitro-cellulose, with a silver ‘spaghetti’ logo headstock transfer
              applied in the traditional way – above, not beneath the lacquer.
            </li>

            <li className="blog-li">
              -- A black, single-layer bakelite scratchplate.
            </li>
            <li className="blog-li">
              -- Three adjustable brass bridge saddles.
            </li>
            <li className="blog-li">
              -- Original designalnico V pickups, made to vintage spec.
            </li>

            <li className="blog-li">
              -- Cloth-covered, as opposed to plastic-insulated internal wiring,
              and an authentic latter 1952 electrical circuit, without the
              option to combine the sound of the bridge and neck pickups. On the
              three positions of the switch you can either get: bridge pickup
              alone, neck pickup alone, or neck pickup drastically low-pass
              filtered for the woolliest, bassy tone you can imagine.
              Interestingly, the very earliest Tele wiring circuit, used briefly
              by Fender prior to this one, actually did allow twin pickup
              sounds. But because the combination was achieved via a rotary pot
              rather than the selector switch, there was no room for a standard,
              capacitor-filtered tone control. Hence, players could not remove
              any of the bright top end from the bridge pickup. In implementing
              a standard tone control to address this problem in 1952, Fender
              were faced with a choice. They could either lose the mega-woolly
              bass sound from the switch selections to accommodate the
              neck/bridge combined tone, or they could keep the woolly bass and
              forego the neck/bridge combination altogether. The woolly bass won
              the day (well, it was 1952), and a combined neck/bridge pickup
              tone did not re-appear on Telecasters until 1967, when the third
              pickup switching circuit (neck-both-bridge) was brought in. The
              third circuit has been standard on regular Telecasters to this
              day, and has even been used (inaccurately) on many Fender pre-CBS
              Reissues.
            </li>

            <li className="blog-li">
              -- Nickel-plated Kluson-type machine heads.
            </li>

            <li className="blog-li">
              -- Flat-head (as opposed to cross-head) mounting and fixing
              screws.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            Today’s American Standard Telecaster doesn’t have any of the above
            features. It has a cheaper, quicker and less attractive poly finish
            on both neck and body, uses modern plastic in place of the
            old-school materials like bakelite and cloth, has different pickup
            spec, different machine heads, etc. To someone who appreciates the
            subtleties and beauty of the vintage feature set, this ’52 Reissue
            holds immense charm and appeal.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4 className="blog-title">THE EXAMPLE IN QUESTION</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            This particular example is, as I mentioned, an early ‘90s
            recreation. Its finish is stunning, and captures very convincingly
            that slight semi-opaque colouring over the ash body, as well as
            nailing the shade to perfection. In contrast, the finish on the
            current version of this USA ’52 Reissue, as depicted on the Fender
            site, doesn’t look right to me. The translucency of the blonde looks
            too great, and the colour looks too weak, giving something more like
            a natural finish than a vintage blonde. Maybe it’s just the photo
            Fender have used – I don’t know – but this early ‘90s job looks much
            more realistic to me. I suppose that potentially takes us into the
            slightly wacky territory of old vintage reissues being better than
            new vintage reissues, and vintage reissues made two decades ago
            acquiring a ‘vintage’ merit of their own.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I used to own this guitar, having bought it brand new, in a tweed
            case, in 1992. There’s no denying that I loved the look, and the
            construction quality was truly sublime. However, as I mentioned
            elsewhere on this site, between 1983 and 1985 I owned the Squier
            version of this reissue – an original JV Series ’52 Tele, which was
            actually my first ever electric guitar. Inevitably, I was going to
            compare this USA ’52 Reissue with the Squier, which was essentially
            exactly the same instrument bar its (poly) finish, and its use of a
            fake bakelite scratchplate rather than a real one. On paper, the US
            model was more in keeping with the real ‘52, but in practice the
            Squier, if you’ll pardon the expression, kicked US reissue’s ass.
            The Squier was lighter in weight and more boisterous in tone.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            By the early 1990s, I’d also owned a number of other Telecasters,
            the best of which was a sunburst MIJ ’62 Reissue, which I still own
            today. So not only was I comparing the US ’52 Reissue with the
            Squier I’d formerly owned – I was also comparing it with other
            Teles, in some cases, side by side. Much as I loved and appreciated
            the seminal image and vintage accuracy of this butterscotch blonde,
            I rarely played it because I didn’t find it as exciting in use, or
            as easy to play, as the MIJ ’62. The neck on this USA ’52 reissue is
            pretty bulky and I found it quite slow. The profile is probably
            authentic to the letter, but is it gonna keep me playing for hours
            on end? No.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I suppose it’s at this point that you start to question whether
            building vintage reissues exactly like the originals is such a great
            idea. It could be argued that if you don’t want the exact spec of a
            ’52 Tele, then you shouldn’t be buying a ’52 Reissue. But equally it
            could be argued that it’s tragic to be precluded from enjoying the
            beauty and charm of a guitar like this because the neck’s too bulky.
            And in fact, those who say that a vintage reissue should offer some
            concessions to the modern age, have an extra piece of ammunition as
            regards this Telecaster. If a replica is 100% accurate, then yes, it
            matters if you take a bit of licence with a given feature. But this
            replica isn’t 100% accurate in the first place. The spacing of the
            two dot markers at the twelfth fret is too narrow. Pre-CBS replicas
            from Fender USA have widely suffered from this problem – caused by a
            change in the mass production tooling at the American factory during
            the early ‘60s. An inaccuracy like this makes an insistence on
            reproducing ‘slow’ neck profiles a bit pointless. Ironically enough,
            the Squier version had both a faster neck, and the correct twelfth
            fret dot spacing. Two more reasons to prefer it to this American
            Fender job.

            The sounds from the USA '52 Reissue Tele are not the same as those
            from a modern Standard. With a different wiring circuit under the
            control plate that's inevitable, but details like the '52's brass
            bridge saddles, and of course its vintage-replica pickups, further
            help to impart a more retro tonal character. Even with the tone
            control full up, the '52's bridge pickup sounds pretty full and
            rounded. It does have some Fender bite, but as Telecasters go it's
            quite subdued and mellow. An attractive sound, but heading more
            towards 'steel guitar' than clattering indie rock or Wilko Johnson
            territory. The middle selection on the three-way switch gives the
            neck pickup alone on this guitar, and again it's pretty rounded and
            mellow, with a strong bottom end.
          </p>

          <p>
            You expect, what with the ash/maple wood combination, that this Tele
            is going to be overtly bright, but it's not. In the grand spectrum
            of trad-style Teles, it's a sweetie. Think of the average Tele
            sound, back the tone off a touch, add some bass boost, compress the
            sustain a little, and you have a good sense of what this one's like.
            The final position on the selector switch (the front position) gives
            that unusable bass tone only. Stripped of harmonics, it has no
            treble cut whatsoever. I quite seriously can't think of anything
            you'd play with it - not while you were sober, anyway. You have to
            forgive the Fender company of 1952 for that one selection though.
            Given the extent of the features and sounds which have fitted
            perfectly into 21st century styles, designing this instrument just a
            few years after World War Two has to rank as an almost surreal,
            almost psychic, example of foresight.

            I do miss being able to open a guitar case and see one of these
            blonde beauties staring out at me. But I know if I’d kept this
            instrument it wouldn’t have seen much use, and perhaps the only
            thing I really question is why I bought it in the first place. I
            guess it was party the irresistible looks, and partly an attempt to
            replace my much missed Squier JV '52 from nearly a decade earlier.
            With unlimited funds at my disposal, I'd have kept the USA '52, just
            to look at. But, constantly in need of extra cash, I was bound, in
            the end, to question the point of keeping a guitar I wasn't playing.
