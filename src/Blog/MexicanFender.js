            Mexican Fender / Squier Strats: The Mid 1990s Boom
          </h2>
          <p>Saturday, 11 July 2020 </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            After a pretty grim start, Fender’s Mexican guitar production
            initially remained somewhat muted within the overall range on the UK
            market. In the early ‘90s, when the first Mexican Fender Strats
            arrived in England, Japan was still very much an unassailable
            provider of the immediate sub-USA production tier...
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Indeed there were many guitarists, me included, who considered the
            Made in Japan range typically better than the USA output in terms of
            feel and performance. And it was a poorly-kept secret that some
            highly knowledgeable retailers believed Fender’s Japanese Vintage
            Reissues were the best choice of new Fender Strat on the market. So
            the idea that the fledgling Fender Mexico could simply replace
            Fender Japan in 1991 or 1992 was unthinkable.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            But moving into the mid 1990s, things were rapidly changing. The
            exchange rate on the Yen was rapidly worsening for importers, and
            Fender was having an extremely hard time keeping a lid on the prices
            within the Japanese range.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            As an illustration of that, when the blonde MIJ Jaguar and
            Jazzmaster models were introduced in 1994, they came in with UK
            retail prices of £814 a piece. They did have gold-plated hardware,
            but even so, £814 was USA price territory in 1994 – too high for
            non-USA production. Meanwhile, the bog standard MIJ Vintage Reissue
            Strats had escalated from £386 to £555 in a two year period, and
            despite their lovely feel and sound potential, they were a lot
            cheaper to produce than the nitro-finish USA versions with accurate
            electrics and period hard case.
          </p>
          <br />{" "}
          <p>
            Due to the global economic conditions, Fender’s Japanese export
            guitars could no longer significantly undercut USA models with
            quality and spec like for like. The only way to make MIJ guitars
            significantly cheaper in Europe was to downgrade their spec and/or
            quality control. That could be done in any country, and indeed had
            already been done to these instruments in Japan.
          </p>
          <br />{" "}
          <p>
            Fender saw Mexico as its sub-USA production tier saviour. With
            marked improvements to the assembly quality of the Mexican guitars
            over their first two years of full availablity, there was a real
            prospect of the buying public accepting them in some new mid point
            areas of the price range. 1994 was a key time to implement a new
            production strategy as it was on forecast for (and did indeed
            eventually achieve) all-time record-breaking Fender Stratocaster
            sales.
          </p>
          <br />{" "}
          <p>
            But even more significantly, the increasingly prohibitive conditions
            re Japanese imports were also stopping long-time bellyaches Tokai
            and Fernandes from flooding their vintage reissues into the UK and
            European lower-mid price territory. All Fender had to do was fill
            out those price points with well-made instruments that didn’t say
            “Korea” or “Taiwan” on them, and they could turn an impending crisis
            into a party of epic proportions.
          </p>
          <br />{" "}
          <p>
            By the first half of 1994, Mexican products had only got as far as
            replacing the Japanese Fender “Standard” range. Namely, the
            Stratocaster, Telecaster, Precision Bass and Jazz Bass in a single
            variant each. In fact if you counted left-handers, the Mexican
            builds hadn’t even ousted Japan from the Standard range. But Fender
            was about to bring Mexico into a much more central position.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4 className="blog-title">THE PLAN</h4>
          <p>
            Part of the plan was to take some of the weight (and dependency) off
            the MIJ Vintage Reissue series within the immediate sub-USA
            production tier. With Japanese prices sharply escalating, too much
            reliance on these MIJ retro revivals could see the brand losing its
            grip on the mid and lower mid budget areas in the near-term future.
            Even though it wasn't a Strat copy per se, the Taiwanese Yamaha
            Pacifica 604 was already a very hot seller and was ready to give
            Fender a right battering at the first sign of a void around the £350
            to £400 mark. Fender didn't just need Strats to deal with the
            Pacifica - they needed Strats with bridge humbuckers.
          </p>
          <br />{" "}
          <p>
            So a great way to weight the centre of gravity away from the
            Japanese reissues, whilst responding to the threat of the Pacifica
            at the same time, would be to return to something like the old
            pre-1988 Made in Japan structure. That structure had comprised
            multiple “Standard” and “Contemporary” Stratocaster options with a
            range of pickup and hardware permutations. It had collapsed in
            latter ’87 after full-scale Fender USA production restarted and the
            whole of the Squier output was reallocated to Korea. If the popular
            mid ‘eighties MIJ range could be revived with mid ‘nineties trends
            in mind, and with Mexican manufacture, it could render the ultimate
            fate of the MIJ reissues far less of a concern for Fender. And it
            would be a great weapon against rivals like Yamaha into the bargain.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            A comprehensive plan was thus developed and activated. It would mean
            a number of things for the Stratocaster…
          </p>
          <ul className="blog-li">
            <li className="blog-li">
              1. Retention of the basic Mexican Fender Standard, realistically
              selling at around £330 - £340 (R/H). It should be noted, however,
              that the left-handed (non-USA) Standard Strat was still made in
              Japan in 1994, as had been the case right through the tenure of
              the Mexican Standard up until that point.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li className="blog-li">
              2. Replacement of the Japanese Squier Silver Series Stratocaster
              with a Mexican equivalent, to carry full Fender branding (plus a
              small “Squier Series” logo) and be known as the “Fender Squier”.
              The realistic price was expected to remain broadly in the same
              territory as the Silver Series, at around £250 in real world
              retail.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li className="blog-li">
              3. Migration of the manufacture of the Japanese Fender Squier
              Floyd Rose model (rosewood fingerboard only) across to two Mexican
              Fender Floyd Rose models – to cover both maple and rosewood neck
              spec. I say migration because there was a point in ‘94 at which
              both the MIJ and MIM Floyd Rose models were listed by Fender
              themselves. It was not a straightforward replacement.
            </li>
            <p>
              The Japanese Fender Squier Floyd Rose Strat – model number
              125-5000 – had a full Fender spaghetti logo and a small “Floyd
              Rose Squier Series” on its headstock. It also had a foto-flame
              finish.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Regardless of any tinkering or similarity to the subsequent MIM,
              this MIJ model could always be distinguished by its 12th fret
              marker dots, which had the wide FujiGen Gakki spacing and not the
              narrow USA spacing of the period. All Mexican Strats of the time
              had narrow USA fingerboard dot spacing. Also, typically, the
              Mexicans had poplar bodies whereas the Japanese had basswood or
              alder. Both the MIJ and MIM version had a humbucker at the bridge
              and single coils in the middle and neck positions. The MIJ neck
              was natural-finished, whereas the MIM had the new for ’94 Mexican
              vintage honey finish.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The Mexican Floyd Rose II-fitted Strats 113-1100 (rosewood board)
              and 113-1102 (maple neck) would realistically retail at around
              £375-£399, but could be found in adverts at anything between £363
              and £435. £435 was the full MRSP.
            </p>
            <br />
            <li className="blog-li">
              4. Introduction of a more broadly targeted Contemporary Strat with
              a bridge humbucker and black plastic trim, but otherwise a vintage
              look. This guitar, available only as a right-hander, had an MRSP
              of £468 but could realistically sell at below £400. As part of the
              Mexican Contemporary feature set (which also applied to the Floyd
              Rose), it had a honey-tinted neck and headstock finish, and a
              Fender spaghetti logo. These Mexican spag logos differed from the
              USA and MIJ vintage reissue versions, in that they had a
              registered trademark circle after the word Fender. The body was
              poplar but veneer-treated front and back, for a presentable
              aesthetic on the sunbursts and the blonde variant. The veneering
              was officially specified as ash. Initially and very, very briefly,
              all the pickups were Korean. Then before the end of ’94, Mexico
              began producing their own single coils so only the bridge
              humbucker was Korean. Subsequently, production of the bridge
              humbucker was transferred to Mexico too.
            </li>
            <br />
            <p>
              As well as reviving the character and aura of the mid ‘eighties
              Contemporary Strats, the ‘94 Mexican Contemporary looked like a
              rigorously calculated attempt to diminish the importance of the
              Japanese Vintage Reissues. Fender Frontline erroneously billed
              this guitar as USA-made in 1994. For the benefit of anyone who has
              that famous Kurt Cobain issue, I can 100% confirm that the listing
              is wrong, and that Fender Contemporary Strat models 013-5600 and
              013-5602 were always MIM. That said, the wood blanks were rough
              shaped in the Corona factory and there was some USA-made hardware.
              A multi-national effort then, but (unlike the later California
              Series) assembled in Mexico and therefore not eligibile for Made
              in USA status.
            </p>
            <br />
            <li className="blog-li">
              5. Introduction of a cost-cut Richie Sambora signature model, for
              players whose budget could not stretch to the £1,475 USA Sambora
              Strat. The MIM Sambora’s official, full retail price was £499,
              making it the most expensive Strat in the MIM line in 1994. It was
              another Floyd Rose model, but featured a DiMarzio PAF Pro
              humbucker in the bridge position, rather than the standard Korean
              or MIM pickups of the time. And purchasers did also get Richie
              Sambora’s signature on the headstock. The four colour options
              included black, white, metallic crimson and a rather unconvicing
              Lake Placid Blue.
            </li>
            <p>
              So, this was a major opening up of the market, with an obvious
              intention to release the overall mid and lower-mid price point
              areas from the grip of Japanese production.
            </p>
            <br />
          </ul>
          <h4 className="blog-title">DID THE ’94 MEXICAN STRATS SUCCEED?</h4>
          <p>
            Influxing the range with MIM guitars was a plan that had to work,
            because even setting aside exchange rates, on the global market
            Fender Japan was eventually going to rise out of its price tier
            altogether, and Fender could not just abandon that price tier.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In reviews, the new for ‘94 Mexican Strats didn’t exactly set the
            world alight. There was no sign of those glowing, sometimes even
            drooling appraisals that had routinely greeted the MIJ Strats in the
            ‘80s and early ‘90s. But the actual market took to the MIMs
            extremely well indeed – sometimes to the dramatic detriment of MIJ.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4 className="blog-title">
            MIM FENDER SQUIER SERIES VS MIJ SQUIER SILVER SERIES
          </h4>
          <p>
            Perhaps the most obvious instance of this was the switch from Squier
            MIJ Silver Series to Fender MIM Squier Series. The full MRSPs in
            late 1994 were…
          </p>
          <ul className="blog-li">
            --- £295 for the incoming Fender branded MIM Squier Series Strat.
          </ul>
          <ul className="blog-li">
            --- £285 for the outgoing MIJ Squier Silver Series Strat.
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            Before the MIMs arrived, the MIJs were hanging on at around £235 to
            £249 in real world retail. However, when the MIM replacement hit the
            market, selling for around £250, purchase of the MIJ Squiers ground
            to a sharp halt. Dealers had two options. Either take the MIJ
            Squiers down to the £199 ballpark, or simply watch them sit on the
            racks whilst everyone bought the MIM Fender Squiers. It took over a
            year for the remaining stocks of MIJ Squiers to finally sell out,
            and by the end of that period they were going for Korean prices.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We can spoil the fairytale and say that the preference here was down
            to branding. If you’ve got two identically priced new Strats on a
            shelf, and one headstock says “Squier Stratocaster” while the other
            says “Fender Stratocaster”, almost everyone is going to buy the one
            that says “Fender Stratocaster”. Even if it also says “Squier
            Series” in small print, and even if it’s marginally inferior as a
            product to the “Squier Stratocaster”, didn’t get such a good review,
            etc. Because that’s how branding works.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            But the difference still has to be undetectable to the buyer. True,
            these were not guitars for connoisseurs or experts, but neither were
            they guitars for congenital idiots. They had to provide a playable
            and usable tool for the consumer. They had to be worth the money. If
            something is not worth the money, word soon gets around. So whilst
            the Fender branding did kickstart the success of the Mexican Squier
            Strats, they were good enough as a product to maintain that success.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            And I know you’re going to ask because they looked virtually the
            same, so… Difference between the Mexican Fender Squier and the
            Mexican Fender Standard Strats?:
          </p>
          <p>
            The Squiers had single-layer scratchplates as opposed to the
            Standards’ three-layer, and the electrics/pickups in the Standards
            were superior. Both the MIM Standard and the MIM Fender Squier had
            modern style pallid ‘satin’ neck finishes rather than the vintage
            honey finish found on the MIM Contemporaries of the time.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4 className="blog-title">DIFFERENT LEAGUE</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            What was undeniable, was that the Mexican Fender and Squier Strats
            of late 1994 were in a different league from the first
            internationally available Mexican Fender models of 1991. The “Class
            of ‘94” can be considered the real architects of Fender Mexico’s
            rise in the public consciousness and regard. They would pave the way
            for more star-associated Strats like the Jimmie Vaughan-endorsed
            Tex-Mex. And after that, a clever system in which the Mexican
            facility could be used essentially as an outsource shop,
            contributing to a Corona-based production process while some end
            products, transported back to Corona for assembly, could
            legitimately be labelled “Made in USA”. That was the California
            Series.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Arriving in force to cater for a wide range of tastes, the Mexican
            Stratocasters may have wooed the pragmatist rather than the
            romantic, but they quickly won over their price points, and gave
            Fender’s rivals massive headaches in finding a suitable response.

              <h3>Mexican Fender / Squier Strats: The Mid 1990s Boom</h3>
          <p>Saturday, 11 July 2020 </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            After a pretty grim start, Fender’s Mexican guitar production
            initially remained somewhat muted within the overall range on the UK
            market. In the early ‘90s, when the first Mexican Fender Strats
            arrived in England, Japan was still very much an unassailable
            provider of the immediate sub-USA production tier...
          </p>
          <br />
